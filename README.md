- 👋 Hi, I’m @pemoeda08
- 👀 I’m interested in .NET, Python, Golang, Rust and anything low-level.
- 🌱 I’m currently active in developing .NET apps

Currently I have a goal to make a virtual webcam device to process from real webcam data that can be streamed to other apps that support Webcam such as Zoom, Discord, etc.
